  summary: |
    After a long period of preparation, Yao 0.9.1 is officially released!
    We dare not say how great Yao is, but the fact is that we have indeed created a new creature. 
    In the open source world, there is no such logic-driven front-end and back-end integration low-code development framework as Yao. 
    Yao, provides another possibility for application development. This possibility allows enterprises and developers to gain a head start by greatly improving productivity in this rapidly changing era. 
    Let each of us enjoy the convenience of digitalization.
