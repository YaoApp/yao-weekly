## Is YAO low-code?

Our positioning of YAO is to provide developers with application development and running tools.

YAO does not change development habits, does not kidnap users, and is not a one-time code. Applications developed using YAO are easier to upgrade and maintain.

It is hoped that after several years of polishing, in the field of enterprise application development, YAO can help creators focus on design and artistic creation like Unreal Engine. One person or a small team of several people can create excellent works that are popular in the world.

It doesn't matter if it's low-code or not, and we don't bother with concepts. What matters is what YAO can help developers do and how to do it better.
