## What is YAO?

![yao-arch-white.png](https://website.yaoapps.com/images/yao-arch-white.png)

YAO is an open-source application engine, written in Golang, in the form of a command-line tool that can be downloaded and used immediately. It is suitable for developing business systems, website/APP API, admin panel, self-built low-code platforms, etc.

YAO adopts a flow-based programming model to implement various functions by writing YAO DSL (Logical Description in JSON format) or using JavaScript to write processes. The YAO DSL can be written in several ways:

1. Purely hand-written

2. Use automated scripts to generate contextual logic

3. Use the visual editor to create by "drag and drop"

## Developer feedback

After the first release, YAO has been recognized and spread by some developers. The developers who have used YAO currently cover more than 200 countries and regions around the world, and the popularity has exceeded our expectations. Thanks for your support, we will continue to work hard and strive to make YAO better. Welcome to the experts who are interested in this project, to build and share with us.

During this time, we have received a lot of compliments and a lot of criticisms.

for example:

Your documentation is incomplete, and the key processor documentation cannot be found?

Much of the processes chapter in the tutorial documentation is unavailable!

Can you provide documentation for workflow usage?

...

Another example:

Are we unemployed?

Is writing JSON not programming?

Low code, just a joke.

Low-code is cool for a while, maintaining is in hell.

...

**In the new version, we have solved these problems!**

## New version improvements & new features

In the past few months, we have improved the documentation, fixed several bugs, and launched a series of important functions!

- **[Improve the document]** The document has been rewritten, the document structure has been optimized, and some missing contents have been supplemented.

- **[INFRA & YAO Cloud]** INFRA has launched a small-scale public beta, supports one-click deployment of YAO applications, and will provide application hosting services soon.

- **[Integrated software and hardware LocalSaaS]** Determine ARM device selection, performance and stability testing; YAO applications support software and hardware integrated mode, which can be used in many scenarios of edge computing.

- **[YAO DSL]** Optimize the DSL specification and part of the document structure, making it easier to write and maintain.

- **[YAO Widgets]** Widget supports customize, and provides more built-in Widgets, you can use DSL to quickly implement more functional modules, and you can even easily build your own low-code platform.

- **[Socket & WebSocket support]** Added Socket & WebSocket commands to establish connections and expand the available scenarios of YAO.

- **[Concurrent Tasks & Scheduled Tasks]** Quickly configure concurrent tasks and scheduled tasks through a DSL, and tasks with a large amount of computation support asynchronous backend running.

- **[Store KV Storage]** provides Store storage DSL and JavaScript API, which can be used for data caching.

- **[More Processors]** Provide a series of built-in processors such as table schema changing, import and export, etc., to realize various functions more conveniently.

- **[Fix some bugs]** Fixed DNS, hot update, table and other bugs, optimized engine startup and hot update logic in development mode.

## Is YAO low-code?

Our positioning of YAO is to provide developers with application development and running tools.

YAO does not change development habits, does not kidnap users, and is not a one-time code. Applications developed using YAO are easier to upgrade and maintain.

It is hoped that after several years of polishing, in the field of enterprise application development, YAO can help creators focus on design and artistic creation like Unreal Engine. One person or a small team of several people can create excellent works that are popular in the world.

It doesn't matter if it's low-code or not, and we don't bother with concepts. What matters is what YAO can help developers do and how to do it better.

## At last

0.10 is also the last v0 version, and YAO's "Hello World" has finally been written. The next major version upgrade will be the official version 1.0.

We have also opened social network accounts such as Twitter, Youtube, Discord, Medium, etc., and will share the progress of YAO, thinking about software development, usage tutorials, open source YAO applications and some enterprise-level practice cases. Welcome to follow us!
